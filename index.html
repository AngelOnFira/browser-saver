      <p>
        I made this site to leave running in all my Firefox windows. If my
        computer is on, then Firefox should be open. If it's closed, it's
        because I accidentally hit ❌ when trying to switch tabs, or cause I hit
        Ctrl-Shift-Q instead of Ctrl-Shift-W ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

        Are you interested in making this website look better? Please read
        <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this first</a>. You can then
        find the repo <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">here</a>

      <button type="button">
        Click this button to get started. It doesn't do anything, but it focuses
        you on the window, which is needed for this to work. Alternativly, if
        you don't fancy buttons, you can click anywhere else on the page. I
        think. I'm not a frontend developer and I don't intend on clicking
        anywhere except this button. You're on your own if you choose not to
        click the button.
      </button>
